Apparently there are a lot of ways to deploy a website. The information listed here are just my notes regarding this problem 

# deploy-a-website
**A static website** (sometimes called a flat page/stationary page)

is a website that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic website, which is generated by a web application 

**Deploying**
means making the content or software accessible and available for use 

## 3 steps
1. Generating the website
2. Deploying it to the public Internet
3. Assigning it a custom domain name

#### Things that will be useful to know 
1. Command Line 
2. Git and how GitHub works
3. Jekyll?

##### Points to note
Jekyll is a simple static site generator that can be utilized to generate a ready-to-publish website within seconds 

 `gem install jekyll` Use this command to generate Jekyll
 
 `jekyll new my-portfolio-site` Use this command to generate a new directory
 
 `ls` 
 
 `cd` is used to navigate to the site's directory
 
 `jekyll serve` is used to start a local server 

**Github Pages**'s benefits
1. Easy setup 
2. Troubleshooting your site
3. Updating and maintaining your site
cd personal-websites

_Commands that are useful for Github_
`git init` initialize a repo
`git remote add origin 'website'`
`git remote rm origin 'website'`
`git remove -v` this command lists all the Git removes and their responding URLs

**Domain Name** DNS (Domain Name System)
